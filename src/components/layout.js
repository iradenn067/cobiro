                    First thing you see is a video showing off{" "}
                    <a href="#AFFLINK#">Bitcoin Revolution</a> in all of its
                    glory. The advertising is big and bold and in your face but
                    it is an American product and that's how they do things.
                    Anyway, you simply submit your name and email address below
                    the video to get started.

                    . As I was navigating the deposit page, my mobile rang. It
                    was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but
                    then I realised it was obviously from{" "}
                    <a href="#AFFLINK#">Bitcoin Revolution</a> . Sure enough, it
                    was my own personal account manager. His service was great.
                    He took me through the entire funding process. They accept
                    all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American
                    Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which
                    is around £180 or $250 cause the platform works in US
                    Dollars.

                    Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of
                    software, set the trade amount to the recommended $50 and
                    enabled it. The <a href="#AFFLINK#">Bitcoin Revolution</a>{" "}
                    software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was
                    concerned at first but let it do its thing. I left it active
                    for about an hour and went and watched TV. When I came back,
                    my account balance read $1,592.37! That's £1,127! I had just
                    turned £180 into £1,127 in the space of an hour!
